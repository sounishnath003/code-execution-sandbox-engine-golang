# Code Execution Sandbox Engine

**Description**

Code Sandbox Runner is a web-based application that enables users to submit and execute code snippets in various programming languages within isolated Docker containers. This project provides a secure and scalable environment for running untrusted code, making it ideal for educational purposes, coding competitions, and online code execution services.

**Features**

* **Multi-language Support:** Execute code in multiple programming languages, including Python, Java, and more.
* **Docker-based Isolation:** Each code submission runs in its own dedicated Docker container, ensuring isolation and security.
* **REST API:** Submit code and retrieve execution results through a well-defined REST API.
* **Job Queueing:** Efficiently manage and execute multiple code submissions concurrently using a job queue and a pool of worker processes.
* **Detailed Error Handling:** Provides informative error messages and timestamps for debugging and troubleshooting.
